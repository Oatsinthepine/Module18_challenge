# Module18_challenge
This repo contains supplementary information for Tableau City Bike visualisations.

For this challenge. I used the downloadable file from the url provided in City Bike Trip Data. I used two files, first is JC-202308-citybike-tripdata.csv, the second file is JC-202408-citybike-tripdata.csv. I intend to explore and create visualisations for the citybike data by comparing a single month's trip data in two consecutaive years. Therefore I merged two csv files into one whole file using pandas pd.concat based on common columns. 

All the visualisations are based on this merged file. for details, please visit the "Source_data_cleaning" folder.

For viewing all the plots, please visit my the Tableau Public url.
